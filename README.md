## ðŸŒŸ Project 1: [big-project.js](./big-project.js)

**Description:**  
This project is a motivational message generator built for a portfolio assignment on Codecademy. It demonstrates core JavaScript concepts such as array manipulation, functions, and random selection logic.

**What it does:**

- Combines them into a complete motivational message;
- Logs the result to the console;
- Each execution gives a new, unique message.

**Sample Output:**
